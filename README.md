# LightClock

Fun short project.  A "clock" that changes the color of the LED light strip throughout the day.

6AM Starts Red and grows in brightness
7AM Full Red brightness
Morning Goes Red to Yellow to Greens
Afternoon Goes through the Blues range
Evening Works through Purples and Pinks back to Red
10PM Back at Red, brightness starts to decline
11PM Light turns off.

SevenSeg displays are off by default, hold the EN button to turn them on.
To set the time, hold the EN button and press the increment buttons for hours and decimal (10th hour) increments.  The Period on the first display indicates PM if on and AM if off.  Hours are in hex.

Intended/recommended use is backlighting for a computer monitor/shelf.
